#Verified List

##How to get a verified checkmark
In order to receive a green approval check mark to the right of your user name on /r/codcompetitive, you must be a professional gamer, caster/commentator, or industry insider.

###Requirements
To qualify you or your organization must also be well-known and notable within the wider Call of Duty community. In cases where this is not clear moderators will use a combination of follower/subscriber information, traffic statistics, and their own judgement to decide if you qualify.

###Process to verify
If you meet the requirements, then message the moderators with a link to your well-known Twitter account, blog, web site, et cetera tweeting/posting something like, "I'm &lt;reddit user name&gt; on reddit [@rcodcompetitive](https://twitter.com/rcodcompetitive)," for the purpose of verification.
